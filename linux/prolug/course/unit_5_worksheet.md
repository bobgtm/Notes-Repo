Unit 5 Discussion Post 1: Review the page: https://attack.mitre.org/
1. What terms and concepts are new to you?

* Hardware Additions
* Drive-by Target - operational environment that infect systems which visit a website while browsing. Browser targeted for exploitation.
* Business Relationships - Info about business relationships exposed via phishing, social media, websites, domains, connected network access. 

2. Why, as a system administrator and not directly in security, do you think it’s so important to understand how your systems can be attacked? Isn’t it someone else’s problem to think about that?
- Simply put, it is important to understand how attacks can happen to hold both yourself and your organization accountable for the decisions made about the systems deployed and maintained for the compnay. Gives one the opportunity to both prevent and mitigate any security vulnerabilities. While it might be someone else's *sole* problem to think about in their official professional role, to assume that it is not an admin's problem is incredibly risky. To fail to think about security as an admin is to put a company's systems in jeopardy. 

3. What impact to the organization is data exfiltration? Even if you’re not a data owner or data custodian, why is it so important to understand the data on your systems?
- Data is being produced or consumed on systems. Understanding the data on the system allows us to better understand how to troubleshoot the system given any anomolies in data, what security meausures to implement to protect the data, allows you to understand how services should connect, and gives insight into what system baselines should be established to be handle that data. The exfiltration of that data can jeopardize the company's reputation and business. It may impact other parts of the company's systems should data flow and exchange become impacted.
