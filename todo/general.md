- Read up on dotfiles and what is important for each
- Make sure I have everything I want for my dot files

1. Create some sort of script that I can run in my new VM to download: 
-> python3
-> go
-> c / gcc
-> perl
-> vim / vim plugins
-> neofetch (to add another just for practice). 
2. Upload script to github
3. When I create a new VM: 
--> Pull script 
--> Run updates for whichever system I am on
--> Run script 
---> Make it interactive to see if I want to install any of the above?
