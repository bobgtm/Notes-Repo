# Production App
- Come up with way to edit product names
	- Perhaps a product page with name field, description, image holder? 
- Add force login on all pages


# Website

1. Update Landing Page Subscription images: 
    - images available in email with Jacob
2. Include "FREE shipping on orders over $25"
    - top of landing page or right below subscribe button
3. Move button to top of page
4. Change code so 1 can be handled by Jacob in the future instead of me having to go in and swap out images every time. 

# Completed
- Remove Oh Hey Cafe all together... 
    - Make sure you create a backup in your local git repository. make it pre-main_main by merging your ohhey_remove branch into it, fix conflicts, merge to main_main before merging into main

-. Hide inventory so that each cafe can only see their own inventory. Production should still be able to see all locations
