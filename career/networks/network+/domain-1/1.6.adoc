# 1.6 Compare and contrast Network topologies, architectures, and types

## Key Terms
Mesh::
Every link is a point to point connection wherein every network computer connects to
every other network computer (or switch to switch)
* Every node is connected to every other node
* If one node, data can travel over an alternate path
** Types: 
*** Partial:: 
Many nodes are connected by several nodes might be separated

* Advantages
** Network can be easily scaled without interrupting connectivity
** Dedicated Links
** Traffic is re-routable and simplifies fault identification
** Central node reduces risk of failure

* Disadvantages
** Excessive cabling makes it expensive
** Larger physical footprint as cables need to be run f
** Complex to implement


Hybrid::
Combines two or more topologies

* Advantages
** Scalability
** Flexibility
** Simplifies troubleshooting

* Disadvantages
** Can be complex 
** Can be expensive - Will need to buy more expensive devices with higher port
density/forwarding rates

Star/hub and spoke::
All systems connect using a hub with a central node such as a switch

* Advantages
** Only failed nodes are affected
** Systems are pretty fast. 
** Easy to modify
** Troubleshooting is simple - each node w/ own connection allows for easier
identification

* Disadvantages
** Hub or concentrator failure disables nodes
** Can be slow

Spine-Leaf Architecture::

More switches and cabling
Scaling out instead of scaling up
* Better performance, lower latency, greater capacity, improved scalability


Point to Point::
Connects two devices, one transmitter the other the receiver over a private line

* Though simple, shows up in many complex networks

* Architecture: 
** Simple wherein one node communicates with just another
** Inexpensive
** Reliable connectivity over the single connection
** Highly Secure since there is no intermediary connection
** Little chance of unauthorized access which allows for better security

* Disadvantages: 
** Link failure means total failure so avoid single connections when can
** Scaling is difficult and expensive
** Not suitable for larger areas


Three-tier hierarchical model:: 
Made up the Access layer (where computers plug into switches) which connects to
Distribution layer (where layer 3 switches/routers are located) where Access
connections are aggregated. 
Core layer allows for the internonnection of different networks. 

* Access Layer - Ethernet connection straight to a switch
** Front facing where PCs plug in and users can share data
** Switches and hubs used at this layer

* Distrubition Layer - Policies can be implemented for traffic passing through this
layer.
** Used in multiple local networks 
** Intermediary between core and access layers
** Ensures local traffic stays w/in networks
** Routers connect networks
** IP addresses and routing tables are used

* Core layer - Connections between larger buildings 
** Connects multiple distribution layer devices
** Transmits massive amounts of data
** Fast and Reliable

Collapsed Core Layer (Two-Tier) Architecture::
Access layer is present where clents connect to switch but the core and distribution
layers are combined. Meant for networks which are smaller with no distribution layer

* Advantages
** Suitable for small to medium campuses
** Simplified networking protocols
** Lower cost

* Disadvantages
** Loss of resilience
** Difficult to manage
** Limited scalability

Traffic Flows:: 

* East-West Traffic
** Typically data travelling inside a data center, horizontally in the diagram

** Virtualization Technology
** Converged Infrastructure
** Increased processing that used to be performed by hardware. 

* Issues: 
** High latency impacts performance
*** Delays may occur between servers

* Key considerations
** Insider Threats


* North-South Traffic
** Traffic between data center and elsewhere
*** EX: Client to Internet (Data is travelling through the layers). 

* Network - group or system of interconnected computers that can share resources such as data and applications
* Local Area Network - Term for a particular network in a geographic location such as an office building, single department w/in a corporate office, home office

~ Workgroups are sometimes set up to isolate access to resources based on departments or segments within a company. One LAN might be a separate workgroup each with its own resources and devices connected to those resources. 
~ To connect two LANS we can yuse a router

### Common Network Components

1. Workstations - powerful comps w/ > 1 CPU whose resources are available to other users on the network to access. Often employed as systems that end users use on a daily basis

1a. Clienty machine != workstation since CM is any device on a network that can ask for access to resources

2. Servers - Usually run as specialized machines designed to handle one important labor intensive job.
    | File | Mail | Print | Web | Fax | Application | Telephony | Proxy 

3. Hosts - Any network Device with an IP address

### Network Types
1. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - covers large metro area to interconnect various buildings, facilities over a carrier provider network. 

2. Wide Area Network (WAN) - SPan large geographic distances
a. need a router port or ports
b. span larger geographic areas and/or link disparate locations
c. usually slower than LAN
d. utilize private or public data transport media such as phone lines

3. Personal Area Network (PAN) - close proximity connections via ethernet, usb, buletooth, infrared or ZigBee

4. Campus Area Network (CAN) - covers limited geographical network such as a college or corporate campus. Interconnects LANs in various builidng and offers Wi-Fi component for roaming users. b/w LAN & WAN in scope

5. Storage Area Netowork (SAN) - designed for, used exclusively by, storage system. Interconnect Servers to storage arrays containning centralized storage media

6. Software-defined Wide Area Network (SDWAN) - virtual WAN architecture. Software used to manage connectivity, devices, and servies. Make changes based on current operations
a. Multiprotocol Label Switching - imposes labels (numbers) to data and then uses those labels to forward data when it arrives at the MPLS network
a1. labels assigned on edge of MPLS network w/ forwarding inside MPSLNet based on lables through virtual instead of physical links.
