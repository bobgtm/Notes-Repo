Compare and contrast transmission media and transceivers.
and types.

== Wireless
* Important to consider speed and range
** Higher frequency = higher bit transfer 
*** 2.4 has a great range whereas 5 does not


* 802.11 standards
** Radio based transmission
*** 2.4 ghz band and 5 ghz

** 802.11a
*** 54 Mbps at 5GHz

** 802.11b
*** 11 Mbps @ 2.4 GHz

** 802.11g
*** 54 Mbps at 2.4GHz
*** uses multiple antennas at wireless device

** 802.11ac
*** 433 Mbps to 1.3Gbps over 5GHz
*** Uses multiple channels to increase throughput to a single station

** Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax)
*** Theoretical sppeds of 9.6Gbps both 2.4 and 5 Ghz

*** Wi-Fi 6E
*** Speeds of 9.6 Gbps over 6GHz
*** hHas a greater range than Wifi
*** Faster than performance than Wi-Fi6

== Cellular
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM):: Changed analog systems into digital telephony system
* Operates in 900 or 1800Mhz band and digitizes and compresses data before transmission

* Time Division Multiple access (TDMA)
** Multiple users sharing same data
** Cellular channels divided into 3 time slots
** Used by GSM, PDC, DAMPS

* Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
** Used in 2G and 3G wireless comms
** Form of multiplexing
** Allows numberous signons on a single transmission channel
** Commonly uses 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz

* Long Term Evolution (LTE) (4G)
** Uses Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access

* 5G
** Still being developed
** Gbps speeds
** Lower latency (near real-time)
** Perform remote operations
** Specific device support

* Satellite

== Wired
* 802.3 standards cover wired ethernet collection of standards at physical layer and
the data link layer

* Single-mode fiber vs. multimode fiber
** SM carries a single mode or beam of light down the cable 
*** Transmitted over longer distances

** MM carries light in different paths
*** Shorter distances but higher speeds

* Twinaxial cable - Designed for reliable, high-speed data transfer
** Reduced interference and crosstalk due to the twisting 


* Ethernet - standard in wired networking
** Key considerations are shielding, length, speed, and location
** Length about 100m from switch to work station 
** Categories defined by shielding, bandwidth, and maximum data rate
*** Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, 7 , 8

* Coaxial cable
** Inner conductior surrounded by insulation
** Encased in conductive shielding and outer jacket
** RG6 and RG11 - common used for cable, telephony, and internet

* Direct Attach Copper Cables 
** Allows direct comms over copper wire 
** Uses specific connectors and a fixed cable length
** Electromagnetically shielded for stable communication


* Cable speeds
* Plenum vs. non-plenum cable
** Plenum is the space above the office where piping, a/c ducts run. 
** Plenum calbes are fire-resistance used in scenarious where fire safety is
required
** NP aren't fire resistant and may give off toxic fumes when lit. 

== Transceivers
* Protocol
*  Fibre Channel (FC) Technology (point to point)
** Ordered and lossless data transfer - point to point communication 
** Run on fibre optic or copper cables used inside data center

**  Form factors
*** Small form-factor pluggable
(SFP)
*** Quad small form-factor
pluggable (QSFP)

Advantages: 
* remote disaster recoverys
* Business continuity

Commonly used to link servers, switches, and data centers
Small form-factor and lower power consumption
Use Fibre Channel Protocol


* Ethernet Transceivers
** Not connecting to Data storage networks but moreso between switches in a LAN

VS: 

Eth is faster
FC is more reliable
FC has better security
FC mostly used in data centers where you're moving large blocks of data
Eth used to concentrate connections

FC and Eth must be connected to Matched switches and don't really intermix

== Connector types
* Subscriber connector (SC)
** Square connector used at home
* Local connector (LC)
** Square connector body which pushes into receiver
* Straight tip (ST)
** has round metal connector called bayonet 
* Multi-fiber push on (MPO)
* Registered jack (RJ)11 - telephone connection
* RJ45 (8 pin) - used to connect workstations in a building to the network
* F-type - Domestic television equipment
* UPC (Ultra Physical Contact) is rounded in shape 
* APC (Angled Physical Contact) is angled to eliminate some of the reflective light
