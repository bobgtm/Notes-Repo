= Explain common networking ports, protocols, services, and traffic types.

== Protocols Ports

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 20/21:: Both a protocol and a program used for transferring files across an IP network 
* Implented as a standard client server
* Works over TCP/IP Connections
* Can support anonymous connections
* Uses two separate channels 
** Command Channel & The Data Channel (Active: Port 20 | Passive: Any available port#)
* Modes: Active and Passive
* Establishin a connection
** Command line, Web Browser, and FTP Clients
* FTP is not secure

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) 22:: 
SFTP runs over SSH and is designed for transferring files over an encrypted
connection. 
* Uses an ssh session
* Invoke FTP commands over port 22


Secure Shell (SSH) 22:: 
Used to provide secure access for user activity, remote commands, Network Infra management, over an encrypted connection. 
* Establish Connection: 
** Command Line
** SSH Client (Putty, etc)

.Common SSH Commands
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|ssh
|ssh-copy-id

|ssh server.example.org
|ssh-agent

|ssh remote_host_userID@server.exmple.org
|ssh-add

|sshd
|sftp

|ssh-keygen
|
|=== 

Support the use of Symmetrical Keys meaning there are identical keys on each system

Asymmetrical: Private and Public keys 

Hashing: Mathematical algorithm that can be applied to any 

* SSH Security Considerations: 
** Improper File Control is avoided
** Exposed credentials in a script or piece of code
** Key Management

Telnet 23:: 
Earliest remote login protocol providing Terminal Session to Remote Host. Uses TCP port 23. 
* Used to manage devices or apps without GUI, easily accessible
* Means by which commands entered on local, dumb terminal would be passed to the mainframe computer.
* Used most frequently now for devices with no keyboard or monitor (routers)

.Essential Telnet Commands

|telnet hostname
|telnet ip-address:port #

* Advantages
** Versatile
** Cross-platform
** Variety of targets

* Disadvantages
** Unencrypted data exchange
** Security Vulnerabilities

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 25::
Standard Protocol for sending emails and simplifying communication between email servers.
* When we hit "send", hits email server and then is forwarded to the external mail server. 
* SMTP is for sending an email only. 
* Once sent, mesage is spooled to a device while server checks queue for messages 
* Mail servers in the enterprise use SMTP to send within the network only. 
* Ports 465 / 587 used for secured ports, esp 587

* Advantages
** Simplicity: availablity by default and requires little configuration
** Reliablitly
** Ensures delivery
** Multiple outgoing server support

* Disadvantages: 
** Not secure
** Limitations and restrictions on what can be sent out

* Uses handshake where each server agrees on parameters for communication
* Message transfer using multiple commands for sender/recipient, body, attachments, etc... 
* Closes connection

//-

Domain Name System (DNS) 53::
Translates domain names into IP addresses; eliminates need to memorize IP addresses to access a web domain

* DNS Servers: 
** Recursor - System which satisifies the domain request and provides an IP address
*** Examines name that is given and will break down sections of Domain Name (the name spaces) which gives the correct pathway
*** Root nameserver - preconfiged servers where searches by Recursor can begin
*** TLD nameserver - first portion of hierarchy which narrows down namespace
*** Authoritative nameserver - Contains publicly registered names of other DNS servers help by domain holders. 

//-

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 67/68::
Automatically assignes IP address, subnet makse, default gateway, and a DNS server address for efficient communication b/w network endpoints

* Simplifies network IP address management

* Advantages: 
** Accurate IP Configuration chosen from a pool of valid IP pools
** Fewer IP conflicts 
** Any number of client devices
** Effective management of change 

* Disadvantages
** Unauthorized servers might appear on the network 
** Unauthroized clients
** IP address depletion if # of addresses are not available for # of clients

* Components of DHCP
** DHCP server (usually standalone but might also be included in a router)
** DHCP Client (any device which recieves an IP from server)
** IP address pool - range of addresses the server will issue
** Subnet - defines the network boundaries for any given client
** Lease - validity period of the configuration value recieved. Can be customized
through different configurations. 
*** As client ends its lease, it will reach back out to the server to request an
extension 
** DHCP Relay - 

* Allocating IP Address with DHCP: 
** 1. DHCP discover - every system on network will hear packet broadcast from client requesting an IP address
** DHCP offers - Sent by DHCP server in response to DHCP requests also sent in
broadcast
** DHCP Request - Client selects request from all DHCP offers sent from one or more
DHCP servers
** DHCP ACK - Server acknowledges that client has accepted DHCP offer

//-

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) 69:: 
Uses UDP instead of TCP and is less reliable but much faster

* Booting network devices
* Uses PXIE boot
* Device firmware upgrades
* Sends much smaller blocks of data and no authentication is required

* How it works: 
** Read Request or Write Request is sent
** ACK or DATA packet responce 

* Security Considerations: 
** No Encryption
** No Server authentication
** Access to content should be limited

//-

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 80::
Protocol for resource fetching via messages rather than data streams over TCP or TLS

* Considerations: 
** Exstensible - uses would grow and evolve
** Simple
** Connections
** Stateless - any given server doesn't need to retain information about a client

* Uses: 
** Supports caching information 
** Relaxes origin constraints
** Authentication
** Proxy and tunneling
** Can retain connections by using cookies

* Process: 
** Open TCP Connection and client sends HTTP Message
** Client reads the response and then the connection is closed

* Requests: 
** Comes from the client using and HTTP Method such as get, post, etc
** Path\URL of the resource being requested
** HTTP protocol version is included
** Headers can be used but are optional
** Body - actual content of the response to be posted 

* Response: 
** HTTP protocol version
** Status Code
** Status Message
** Headers 
** Body
