Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.
- Separated into 7 conceptual layers which describes functions of a newtorking system and characterizes rules for successful communications across the network. 
- Ideal for equipment manufacterurs when building products that will have to interop with other builds
- Can help break down a problem and isolate the source of the issue



1. Layer 1 - Physical - Standards for the physical media used to transmit data 
- Cables (Copper, Fiber Optic), Connectors (RJ45, Straight Tip),
  Electrical Specs (Transmission Frequencies for wired or wireless
  mediums). 
- Encoding & Signaling: Transforms data from bits into signals which are
  then sent over the network

2. Layer 2 - Data link - Responsible for note-to-node data delivery.
Receives from network layer and passes it to physical layer. It creates
frames and adds destination of physical address 
- Responsible for: 
    - Transmission Control - Establishing and terminating Links 
    - Physical addressing
    - Framing
    - Access Control
    - Flow control of the data
    - Error Control

- Protocols
    - SDLC
    - HDLC
    - SLIP
    - PPP
    - LAP

3. Layer 3 - Network - Accepts from the transport layer and passes to
   the data link layer
- Functions: 
    - Packet addressing
    - Adress conversion
    - Source-to-destination Delivery
    - Routing
        - Independent netwokrs connected to each other, determining best
          path from sources ot destination
    - Internetworking
        - Provide logical connections b/w diff types of networks
    - Logical Addressing - 
        - Define addressing scheme
        - Combine any number of networks 
Layer 4 - Transport 
Layer 5 - Session 
Layer 6 - Presentation 
Layer 7 - Application
