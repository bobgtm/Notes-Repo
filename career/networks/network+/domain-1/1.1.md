Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.
- Separated into 7 conceptual layers which describes functions of a newtorking system and characterizes rules for successful communications across the network. 
- Ideal for equipment manufacterurs when building products that will have to interop with other builds
- Can help break down a problem and isolate the source of the issue



1. Layer 1 - Physical - Standards for the physical media used to transmit data 
- Cables (Copper, Fiber Optic), Connectors (RJ45, Straight Tip),
  Electrical Specs (Transmission Frequencies for wired or wireless
  mediums). 
- Encoding & Signaling: Transforms data from bits into signals which are
  then sent over the network

Layer 2 - Data link
Layer 3 - Network 
Layer 4 - Transport 
Layer 5 - Session 
Layer 6 - Presentation 
Layer 7 - Application
