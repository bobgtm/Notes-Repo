Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.
* Separated into 7 conceptual layers which describes functions of a networking system and characterizes rules for successful communications across the network. 
* Ideal for equipment manufacterurs when building products that will have to interop with other builds
* Can help break down a problem and isolate the source of the issue

//-

1. Layer 1 - Physical - Standards for the physical media used to transmit data 
* Cables (Copper, Fiber Optic), Connectors (RJ45, Straight Tip),
  Electrical Specs (Transmission Frequencies for wired or wireless
  mediums). 
* Encoding & Signaling: Transforms data from bits into signals which are then sent over the network

//-

2. Layer 2 - Data link - Responsible for note-to-node data delivery.
Receives from network layer and passes it to physical layer. It creates frames and adds destination of physical address 
* Responsible for: 
    ** Transmission Control - Establishing and terminating Links 
    ** Physical addressing
    ** Framing
    ** Access Control
    ** Flow control of the data
    ** Error Control

* Protocols
    ** SDLC
    ** HDLC
    ** SLIP
    ** PPP
    ** LAP

//-

3. Layer 3 - Network - Accepts from the transport layer and passes to the data link layer
* Functions: 
    ** Packet addressing
    ** Adress conversion
    ** Source-to-destination Delivery
    ** Routing
        ** Independent netwokrs connected to each other, determining best path from sources ot destination
    ** Internetworking
        ** Provide logical connections b/w diff types of networks
    ** Logical Addressing - 
        ** Define addressing scheme
        ** Combine any number of networks 

//-

4. Layer 4 - Transport 
* Responsible for end-to-end message delivery - using UDP or TCP 
* Error Checking is involved depending on type of connect
* Message acknowledgement and traffic control
* Session multiplexing
* Service Point adressing

//-

Layer 5 - Session 
Layer 6 - Presentation - aka the translation layer as it presents data in a uniform format
* Character code translation
    ** ASCII & EBCDIC

//- 

Layer 7 - Application
