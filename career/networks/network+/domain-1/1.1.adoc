Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.
* Separated into 7 conceptual layers which describes functions of a networking system and characterizes rules for successful communications across the network. 
* Ideal for equipment manufacterurs when building products that will have to interop with other builds
* Can help break down a problem and isolate the source of the issue

//-

1. Layer 1 - Physical - Standards for the physical media used to transmit data 
* Cables (Copper, Fiber Optic), Connectors (RJ45, Straight Tip),
  Electrical Specs (Transmission Frequencies for wired or wireless
  mediums). 
* Encoding & Signaling: Transforms data from bits into signals which are then sent over the network

//-

2. Layer 2 - Data link - Responsible for note-to-node data delivery.
Receives from network layer and passes it to physical layer. It creates frames and adds destination of physical address 
* Responsible for: 
    ** Transmission Control - Establishing and terminating Links 
    ** Physical addressing
    ** Framing
    ** Access Control
    ** Flow control of the data
    ** Error Control

* Protocols
    ** SDLC
    ** HDLC
    ** SLIP
    ** PPP
    ** LAP

//-

3. Layer 3 - Network - Accepts from the transport layer and passes to the data link layer
* Functions: 
    ** Packet addressing
    ** Adress conversion
    ** Source-to-destination Delivery
    ** Routing
        ** Independent netwokrs connected to each other, determining best path from sources ot destination
    ** Internetworking
        ** Provide logical connections b/w diff types of networks
    ** Logical Addressing - 
        ** Define addressing scheme
        ** Combine any number of networks 

//-

Layer 4 - Transport::
Segments and reassembles data into a data stream

Eiteher connection-oriented or connectionless

** Connection-Oriented Communication: 
*** Sender (source) contacts destination's TCP Process sending a SYN packet
*** Destination (receiver) responds by sendin a SYN-ACK packet
*** Source node sends an ACK packet back and a connection is established

* Responsible for end-to-end message delivery - using UDP or TCP 


* Error Checking is involved depending on type of connect
* Message acknowledgement and traffic flow control
** A means for reciever to govern amount of data sent by the sender to prevent overflowing the buffers in the receiving host
*** Segments delivered acknowledged back to sender upon reception
*** Segments not acknowledged must be retransmitted
*** Segments sequenced into proper order upon arrival at destination
*** Data flow maintained to avoid congestion, overloading, and data loss

** A stop, (buff is full), message will be sent so that resources aren't dumped and data lost. 
** A resume or ready indicator will be sent for transmission to be resumed by the sender. 


* Session multiplexing
* Service Point adressing

//-

Layer 5 - Session::
Responsible for setting up, managing, and then tearing down sessiosn b/w Presentation layer entities

* Coordinates communication b/w systems and serves to organize their communication via three modes:
** Simplex - one direction
** Half-duplex - both directions but one direction at a time
** Full-duplex - both directions at a time

Layer 6 - Presentation::
Responsible for data translation and code formatting. Adapts data into a standard format before transmission. 

* Data compression, decompression, encryption, and decryption are associated with this, the "translation" layer


* Character code translation
    ** ASCII & EBCDIC

//- 

Layer 7 - Application::
Responsible for identifying and establishing the availalbility of the intendend communication partner and determining whether sufficient resources for the requested communications exist. 

* Where users communicate with the computer/network stack through application processes, interfaces, APIs which connect to the OS.
