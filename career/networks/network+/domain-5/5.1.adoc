= 5.1 Explain the troubleshooting methodology.

• Identify the problem
- Gather information
- Question users
- Identify symptoms
- Determine if anything has
changed
- Duplicate the problem, if
possible
- Approach multiple problems
individually
• Establish a theory of probable
cause
- Question the obvious
- Consider multiple approaches
o Top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top
OSI model
o Divide and conquer
• Test the theory to determine the
cause
- If theory is confirmed, determine
next steps to resolve problem
- If theory is not confirmed,
establish a new theory or
escalate
• Establish a plan of action to
resolve the problem and identify
potential effects
• Implement the solution or escalate
as necessary
• Verify full system functionality and
implement preventive measures if
applicable
• Document findings, actions,
outcomes, and lessons learned
throughout the process
