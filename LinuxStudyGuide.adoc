=== 1. Accounts
- Create, delete, and modify local user accounts. Manage group accounts. 
* ``*useradd* _username_`` to add user
* ``*passwd* _username_`` to change password
* ``*groupadd* _group name_`` to add a group
* ``*usermod* -aG _group name username_`` to add a user to a group. Usermod used to change a user's account settings after the account has been created. 
* ``gpasswd -a _username_ _groupname_`` to add user to a group
* ``*chage* -l  _username_``
* ``*chage* -E $(date -d +&Y-%m-%d) _username_`` for passwd aging
 note: chage is a frontend to /etc/shadow where account password settings are stored. 

* What is the difference between usermod -L and passwd -l? 

* ``*userdel [-l | -r] _username_`` to change password
* If I wanted to change defaults for users, where would I go? 
** ``/etc/login.defs`` or
** ``/etc/default/useradd``

* What is the skel directory? 
** Located in ``/etc/skel`` it contains files that are copied to new User's home directories automatically
